As of now, this repo only contains a single raw `arm64` kernel image required for [running kerneltests using qemu](https://github.com/parca-dev/parca-agent/blob/main/kerneltest/vmtest.sh).

### TODO
- [ ] Add scripts to automate kernel builds
- [ ] Add support for all kernel versions and architectures we test for
